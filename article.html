            <h1><em>Elon Musk Is ‘Distracting Us’ From Real Tech Issues, AI Figures Warn.</em></h1>
            <div>Elon Musk is one of the tech industry’s most towering figures. Having built a tech empire on the back of an electric roadster, the Tesla and SpaceX founder has sparked the imaginations of thousands if not millions of people, turning them on
                to the possibilities of high technology. However, he now risks doing the tech industry and tech in general more harm than good, as manifested by an increasing number of questionable comments and actions.</div>
            <div>In particular, Pesenti chided Musk for misleadingly overplaying the likelihood of a future ‘evil AI’ takeover, particularly when there are more immediate AI-related concerns to worry about right now, such as how AI and automation could exacerbate
                inequality. As he says in a reply tweet, when it comes to issues raised by AI, Elon Musk "talks about the wrong ones (machines taking over) distracting us from the real issues (e.g. fairness)." These are criticisms echoed by a number of
                other figures within the AI industry, all of whom contend that Musk is effectively setting back public understanding–and development and adoption–of AI.</div>
